This script creates a new resource group, key vault, and then inserts a certificate into that key vault.  
```
# Resource group for the Key-Vault service. 
$resourceGroup = "sfhackRG" 

# Name of the Key Vault service
$keyVaultName = "sfhackKV" 

# Set the Subscription ID; needed if you have more than one - and you need to change to yours
$subscriptionId = "b02264bc-1ea4-4849-abb9-60b5293ed558" 

# Specify the region to locate the keyvault
$location = "West US"

```
